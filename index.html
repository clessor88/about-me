  	<h1>Crystal R Lessor</h1>

  	<h3>Who is she?</h3>
  	  <p><strong>My name is Crystal. I was born on September 7<sup>th</sup> 1988 in Renton WA. I grew up in Graham, and lived
      there for 19 years. When I was 19, I decided to move to South Carolina with my boyfriend. I packed all my stuff into
      my 1994 Toyota Camry and drove from WA to SC, making many stops and memories along the way. It was a completely
      different world. It was hot, it was humid, and it got about 12 more inches of rain a year than WA! About 6 years
      later, I realized that my life there was going nowhere, so I decided to quit my job, leave my boyfriend, and drive
      back from South Carolina to Washington with my best friend. We had a grand time. I got back to WA in October, 2014.
      I got a job at US Bank and love it, but I've decided to think about my future long term and its time for another
      change. I've always liked computers; the hardware and the software sides of it. So, here I am, learning new skills
      to change my career and my life.</p>

    <h3>Work History</h3>
      <p>I started working when I was 19. My first job was in Washington. My next couple of jobs were in South Carolina,
        and my most recent job was back in Washington again. I have never been fired from a job, and I plan on never being fired
        from one.
