  	<h1>Crystal R Lessor</h1>

  	<h3>Who is she?</h3>
  	  <p><strong>My name is Crystal. I was born on September 7<sup>th</sup>1988 in Renton WA. I grew up in Graham, and lived there for 19 years. When I was 19, I decided to move to South Carolina with my boyfriend. I packed all my stuff into my 1994 Toyota Camry and drove from WA to SC, making many stops and memories along the way. It was a completely different world. It was hot, it was humid, and it got about 12 more inches of rain a year than WA! about 6 years later, I realized that my life there was going nowhere, so I decided to quit my job, leave my boyfriend, and drive back from South Carolina to Washington with my best friend. We had a grand time. I got back to WA in October, 2014. I got a job at US Bank and love it, but I've decided to think about my future long term and its time for another change. I've always liked computers; the hardware and the software sides of it. So, here I am, learning new skills to change my career and my life.</strong></p>
